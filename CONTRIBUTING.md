# Contributing

Do you want to contribute? We'd love that.

Our goal is to have mostly projects that are stable and useful to many users.

## How?

The easiest way is to go to https://github.com/BenSchZA/awesome-bonding/blob/master/README.md and click on the "pen" icon in the upper right corner. Make the changes to the file and follow the instructions to create a pull request.

If you want to add an entry to the `README.md` please consider this:

- is it related to token bonding mechanisms?
- if you want to add something, please use the same template.
- please pay attention to the alphabetical ordering.
